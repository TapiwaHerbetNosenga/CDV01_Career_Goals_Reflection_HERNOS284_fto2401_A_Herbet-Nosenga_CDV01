### Part 3: SMART Career Goals

1. **Short-term Goals** (Next 1-2 years):
    
    - List your specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound goals.
    - Explain the rationale behind each goal.

    > To become proficient in all languages required to be a good frontEnd developer, things like Javascript, HTML, CSS and tailwind ReactJS to the point where I can make websites that meet industry standards, this goal is very achievable in the span of 2 years, this goal is relevant to my career as a software developer. This goal will make a valuable member of any developer team that requires front end development.

    >to become proficient in computational thinking and problem solving to the point where I can handle many minor and sometimes more substantial bugs in codebases, this is a achievable goal as my current problem solving skills are already at an acceptable level for somebody of my skill level and its relevant to my career as a software developer as problem solving is key part of any job in software development. This goal will also make me a valuable component of any developer team as any team needs people who are proficient in problem solving.


2. **Long-term Goals** (3-5 years and beyond):
    
    > My long term career goal is to become a capable full stack developer in 5 years time, master the relevant back-end technologies like PHP, python and SQL to the point where my backend code meets and goes beyond industry standards. This goal is very achievable given the time frame and is relevant to my career path as a software developer. This aligns with my interests of databases, my basic analytical skills and my workplace values of skill growth. 

### Part 4: Action Plan
